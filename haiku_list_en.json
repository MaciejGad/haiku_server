    "An old silent pond...\nA frog jumps into the pond\nSplash! Silence again.",
	"In the cicada's cry\nNo sign can foretell\nHow soon it must die.",
	"Winter seclusion\nListening, that evening,\nTo the rain in the mountain.",
	"Over the wintry\nForest, winds howl in rage\nWith no leaves to blow.",
	"Spring rain is falling\nOn the house. Up in the sky\nThe clouds are drifting.",
	"Light of the moon\nMoves west, flowers' shadows\nCreep eastward.",
	"Summer grasses\nAll that remains\nOf warriors' dreams.",
	"After the storm\nThe sun shines, and the moon\nIs full in the sky.",
	"Autumn moonlight\nA worm digs silently\nInto the chestnut."
